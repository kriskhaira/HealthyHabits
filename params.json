{"name":"Healthy Habits","tagline":"Stay healthy and active while using your computer! ","body":"### Welcome to a Healthier Workday\r\nHealthy Habits helps you stay active and healthy while working at your computer! It encourages you to take a short break after extended periods of computer use.\r\n\r\n- Changing schedule? You can modify both the length of work periods and the length of your breaks.\r\n- Took a break on your own? Good job, you’re ahead of the curve! Healthy Habits recognizes when the computer isn’t being used, and won’t prompt you for a break until you come back and work for a while.\r\n- Busy? In the zone? You can tell Healthy Habits to skip this break, and it won’t bother you for a while.\r\n- Feeling extra motivated? Healthy Habits can automatically start once you log in to your computer, ensuring you remain healthy and active while being productive.\r\n- Your computer screen will automatically dim while on break. Because hey, sometimes your computer needs a break, too. \r\n\r\n### Download\r\nHealthy Habits will be available within the App Store soon. In the meantime, you can download the installer [here](https://github.com/pdesantis/HealthyHabits/raw/gh-pages/Healthy%20Habits.pkg).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
